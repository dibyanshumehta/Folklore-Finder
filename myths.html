            <pre>                
                Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Mewar, there lived a beautiful and wise queen named Padmavati. She was known far 
                and wide for her extraordinary beauty and grace.

                Rani Padmavati was married to Raja Ratan Singh, the brave and noble king of Mewar. Their love was deep
                 and true, and they were very happy together.
                
                One day, a visiting priest named Raghav Chaitanya told Raja Ratan Singh about the legendary beauty of the princess
                 of Sinhala (modern-day Sri Lanka), Princess Padmavati. Raja Ratan Singh was curious and decided to see her portrait. He
                  arranged for an artist to paint a portrait of Princess Padmavati based on the priest's description.
                
                When Raja Ratan Singh saw the portrait, he was mesmerized by her beauty. He couldn't stop thinking about her
                 and decided that he must marry her, even though he was already married to Queen Padmavati.
                
                Raja Ratan Singh sought permission from Queen Padmavati to go to Sinhala to marry Princess Padmavati. Queen
                 Padmavati, who loved her husband deeply, agreed to his request but had a plan of her own.
                
                Raja Ratan Singh traveled to Sinhala and met Princess Padmavati. He fell in love with her and asked for her
                 hand in marriage. Princess Padmavati agreed, and the two were married.
                
                As Raja Ratan Singh returned to Mewar with his new wife, news of his return spread across the kingdom. Queen Padmavati
                 was worried that her husband's affection for her might diminish because of his new marriage. She wanted to ensure
                 that her husband still loved her deeply.
                
                To do this, Queen Padmavati devised a clever plan. She arranged a meeting with Raja Ratan Singh, who was deeply
                 in love with both Padmavatis, and told him that she wanted to see him only in a mirror for the first time after his
                  return. Raja Ratan Singh agreed to her request.
                
                When he arrived at the palace, he saw his reflection in the mirror, and Queen Padmavati stood behind him. He saw her in 
                the mirror, and the love in his heart for his first wife, Queen Padmavati, remained as strong as ever. He realized 
                the depths of her love and devotion and was filled with admiration and respect for her.
                
                This story symbolizes the love, sacrifice, and wisdom of Rani Padmavati. She knew how to protect her husband's
                 love and honor their marriage. Rani Padmavati's wisdom and sacrifice are celebrated in Indian folklore and history.
