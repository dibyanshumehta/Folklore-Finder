            <pre>
                Bhangarh Fort is a historic site located in the Alwar district of Rajasthan, India. It was built in the 17th century
                 by Raja Madho Singh for his grandson, Madho Singh I. The fort was known for its stunning architecture and 
                 beautiful surroundings.

                One of the legends about Bhangarh Fort involves a curse that is said to have haunted the place for centuries. According to
                 the legend, a hermit named Baba Balak Nath used to live on the site where the fort was to be built. He gave
                  permission for the fort to be constructed on the condition that the shadow of the fort should never fall on his abode.

                However, one of the successors of Raja Madho Singh extended the fort's height, causing its shadow to reach the
                 hermit's dwelling. This act of disobedience is believed to have angered Baba Balak Nath, and he placed a curse on 
                 the fort and its inhabitants. He declared that if anyone tried to build a structure there, it would be doomed to ruin.

                Over time, various eerie and paranormal experiences have been reported at Bhangarh Fort. People claim to have heard
                 strange noises, seen apparitions, and experienced an unsettling feeling of being watched. Because of these
                  ghostly encounters, the fort has gained a reputation as one of the most haunted places in India.

                Due to these stories and beliefs, the Archaeological Survey of India has placed restrictions on visiting the fort after
                 dark. No one is allowed inside the fort premises at night.

                While the legends and ghost stories surrounding Bhangarh Fort are captivating, it's essential to remember that they are
                 part of folklore and superstition. The real history of the fort, with its impressive architecture and beautiful surroundings, 
                 makes it a remarkable and popular tourist destination in Rajasthan, India.
