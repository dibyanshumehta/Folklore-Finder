            <pre>
                Tipu Sultan, also known as the Tiger of Mysore, was a brave and determined ruler in India during the late
                 18th century. He was born on November 20, 1750, in Devanahalli, Karnataka.

                Tipu Sultan's father, Sultan Hyder Ali, was the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. From a young age, 
                Tipu was trained in warfare and administration, and he proved to be an excellent warrior and a skilled leader.

                When Tipu Sultan became the ruler of Mysore in 1782 after his father's death, he faced many challenges. 
                The British East India Company was expanding its influence in India and was eager to control Mysore.
                 This led to several conflicts and wars between Tipu Sultan and the British.

                One of the most well-known conflicts was the four Anglo-Mysore Wars. In these wars, Tipu Sultan displayed
                 great bravery and military skills. He used innovative technology and tactics in his battles, such as the use
                  of rockets, which earned him the nickname "The Tiger of Mysore."

                Despite his efforts, Tipu Sultan faced defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, and he had to sign the
                 Treaty of Seringapatam in 1799. As part of the treaty, he had to give up a significant portion of his kingdom
                  to the British.

                In 1799, during the war, Tipu Sultan fought valiantly and died defending his capital, Seringapatam
                 (modern-day Srirangapatna). His legacy of bravery and resistance against colonial rule is remembered with
                  respect in Indian history.

                Tipu Sultan is also known for his efforts to modernize his kingdom. He introduced new technologies, built roads,
                 and supported trade and industry. He was also known for his religious tolerance and treated people of
                  different faiths with respect.

                Tipu Sultan's life and legacy continue to be celebrated in India, particularly in the state of Karnataka, where
                 he is remembered as a hero who fought against foreign invaders to protect his kingdom and its people.
